//Create a C++ class Time to represent time objects with hours, minutes, and seconds. Implement the + and - operators to perform addition and subtraction of time objects, respectively. The operators should handle carry-over or borrow of time units as needed. The output should be in the format HH:MM:SS.
//The Time class has three private member variables: hours, minutes, and seconds. The constructor initializes the member variables with default values of 0.
//Calculates the total seconds from both time objects.
//Converts the total seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.
//Returns a new Time object with the calculated values.
//Calculates the difference in seconds between the two time objects.
//Handles negative time differences by converting them to a positive representation.
//Converts the absolute difference to hours, minutes, and seconds.
//Returns a new Time object with the calculated values.
//Prints the time object in the format HH:MM:SS.
