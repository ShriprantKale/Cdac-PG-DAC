A paragraph is a group of sentences that support a main idea and is a fundamental unit of writing. Paragraphs are separated from other paragraphs and text by a space, and are indented to indicate a new paragraph. 
Here are some things to know about paragraphs: 
Structure
A paragraph typically has three parts: a topic sentence, body sentences, and a concluding sentence. The topic sentence is usually the first sentence of the paragraph and introduces the main idea. 
Length
Paragraphs can vary in length, but are usually around 250 words and consist of five or six sentences. However, a paragraph can be as short as one sentence in some writing styles, or longer than five sentences to present more evidence. 
Purpose
A paragraph's purpose is to clearly express the writer's thoughts on a specific point. Good paragraphs answer the questions: what are you trying to tell the reader, why is it important, and how should the reader use the information. 
Unity
A paragraph should focus on a single idea and not wander into different ideas. 
Organization
Paragraphs help organize ideas in a logical order and guide the reader through the writing.
